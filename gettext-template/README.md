# Gettext updates

This action automates the manual steps needed to regenerate the gettext templates if required

## Requirements

This image is intended for use with elementary debian projects. There are a few requirements before getting started:

  1. The project needs to have a deb-packaging branch with the necessary debian packaging for the project. Docs: [debian control](https://elementary.io/docs/code/getting-started#debian-control)
  2. The project needs to use the meson build system

### Environment Variables

In order to create tags and push changes to various branches, the script needs a GitHub token. When using GitHub workflows, the virtual environment [automatically comes with a generated GitHub token secret](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#github_token-secret). However, if your translation branch is protected, you will need to use a Personal Access Token with the `repo` scope, generated by a user who has admin permissions for the repo. To do so:

1. [Generate a Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) from your GitHub user settings
2. Give it the `repo` scope
3. Copy the generated Personal Access Token
4. In the repo's settings, navigate to the "Secrets" tab and "Add a new secret"
5. Name the new secret `GIT_USER_TOKEN` and paste the copied Personal Access Token

#### Git User

Instead of using the default GitHub token (`GITHUB_TOKEN`), you can use a custom Personal Access Token with the `GIT_USER_TOKEN` environment variable. You can also use the following environment variables to set the git user and email:

```yaml
env:
  GIT_USER_TOKEN: "${{ secrets.GIT_USER_TOKEN }}"
  GIT_USER_NAME: "example-user"
  GIT_USER_EMAIL: "exampleuser@example.com"
```

### Specifying a translation branch name

By default, this action will use a branch named 'master' to to push the changes. The branch name can be set via the `translation_branch` input. Example:

```yaml
with:
  translation_branch: 'i18n'
```

### Include the translation template

By default, this action will only rebuild the translation template. It is also possible to include the language by setting the `regenerate_po` input to true. Example:

```yaml
with:
  regenerate_po: 'true'
```

## Examples

### Simple Example

```yaml
name: Gettext updates
on:
  push:
    branches: master
jobs:
  gettext_template:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - uses: elementary/actions/gettext-template@master
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Full Example

```yaml
name: Gettext updates
on:
  push:
    branches: master
jobs:
  gettext_template:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - uses: elementary/actions/gettext-template@master
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        translation_branch: 'i18n'
        regenerate_po: 'true'
```
